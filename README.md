![# Milestone 1 - Voice and Piano Music School](design/mockupMS-1.JPG)

This website was created for the first milestone project of Full Stack Developer Course. The project made is a small website for a Music School. 
This website has been built for a good friend, teacher and founder of the Voice and Piano Music School.
The purpose of this project is to create a new modern website, more attractive and functional for her school, which has already an existing own website (https://vocepian.wordpress.com/).

## UX
The main purpose of the website would be to get people to interest in taking the music classes from this music school. It promotes the positive benefits of learning music to help sell the classes. The website will display the 3 types of classes that they teach: singing, piano and music theory.

### User Stories

##### New users:
* As a user who is thinking about learning a piano or singing, I want to find out information that might convince me to take a class. The option of taking a free trial class would be quite appealing.
* As a user who has already begun learning piano or singing, perhaps I want to find some more formal training, to help me progress, or to add other related skills like music theory.
* As a user who might have children who are interested in music, I want to find out if these classes look appropriate, who the teachers are and where they take place.
* As a user who is thinking about learning the piano or singing, I want to know about the online class options.
* As a user who is thinking to take music classes, I want to know the location of the school so I can attend their classes.
* As a user who is thinking to take music classes, I want to be aware of their values and what makes them unique for the purpose of deciding if they are the best to teach me music classes.
 * As a user who decides to take music classes, I want to access their sign up form in order to register my interest with the school.

##### Business Owner:

* As a owner of the school and want to see the school succeed. I want to clearly display information about upcoming classes in an attractive and informative way, and I want visitors to be able to easily able to contact the school easily.

### Strategy 
I created a moodboard with Adobe Spark (https://spark.adobe.com/)from the research of colors, styles and components to visually illustrate the style I wished to pursue. 
You can see that moodboard [here](design/moodboard.voiceandpiano.pdf)
The following websites were used in the research process for reference and inspiration:
* https://solfeggio.cmsmasters.net/contacts/
* https://www.vivaldimusicacademy.com/
* https://www.playrightmusicltd.com/Piano-Lessons-Dublin/
* http://dublinschoolofmusic.ie/
* https://www.pianosplus.com/blog/piano-news/health-benefits-piano-playing/
* https://www.awwwards.com/

There are 2 main goals of the website:

* to get potential customers to sign up for a class, taking up the option of a free lesson to get a 'taster' for a class. This is probably the main goal.
* to give potential customers information about the music school to entice them to take a class in this school over competitors.

#### Scope plane:
The key features of the website were developed based on user needs. Users should be able to do the following on the website:

* Find out information about classes, content and price
* Learn about the benefits of music
* Booking for a free lesson as a sample.
* View the opinions of other students that have completed the music classes
* Contact the music school 
* Visit social media channels
* Learn more about the music school and its teachers

#### Structure plane
 I grouped the features into four main pages: Home, About, Classes and Contact.
 I wanted the pages to have some consistency, so thought about the homepage hero image, and how the following pages would also start with a header image, which would be shorter than the homepage hero image but following the same pattern. I decided that I didn’t want the images across all devices, except from the hero image of the Home page to cover the full screen because the user would scroll down too much to discover the content of the page.
 
#### Skeleton
 I have included some basic sketching of ideas:
 


 **Initial ideas**
 
- These are initial ideas for the structure of information and pages required, and sketching them down for desktop and mobile on paper as it is quicker.
 - Home Page Desktop version [Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/home-page-desktop-version.jpg)
 - Home Page Mobile version [Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/home-page-mobile-version.jpg)
 - About Page Desktop version [Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/about-page-desktop-version.jpg)
 - About Page Mobile version [Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/about-page-mobile-version.jpg)
 - Classes Page Desktop version [Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/classes-page-desktop-version.jpg)
 - Classes Page Mobile version [Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/classes-page-mobile-version.jpg)
 - Contact Page Desktop and Mobile version[Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/contact-page-desktop-and-mobile.jpg)
 - Structure site [Here](sketch-wireframes-first_ideas/structure-site.jpg)



**Second ideas**
- This formed the basis of my final wireframes, which were created in Figma:
 - Home page [Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/voice-and-piano.home-page.jpg.gz)
 - About Page [Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/voice-and-piano.about-page.jpg.gz)
 - Classes Page[Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/voice-and-piano.Classes-page.jpg.gz)
 - Contact Page [Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/voice-and-piano.contact-page.jpg.gz)

 **Final wireframes** created in Figma
 - Home page [Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/Wireframes-final_ideas/home-pg.png)
 - About Page [Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/Wireframes-final_ideas/about-pg.jpg)
 - Classes page [Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/Wireframes-final_ideas/classes-pg.jpg)
 - Contact page [Here](Wireframes-second_ideas/Wireframes-final_ideas/contact-pg.jpg)

#### Surface

As a starting point I used the image chosen for my landing page which helped to choose the color pallete for the entire website.
Below is a picture of the color palette I got off the website Coolors [https://coolors.co/]

![color-scheme](design/color-scheme.png)

 I used a combination of red, brown and pastel color like peach. 
I decided on this combination because, according to this article [https://99designs.ie/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/]:
* Red can also increase a person’s appetite and can develop a passion for something, in this case would be learning apetite.
* Pastel color like peach can also have an uplifting effect on your mood.
* Brown makes you feel down to earth and creates a sense of stability and support. It’s warm and friendly, practical and dependable, and can also represent the old fashioned and well established.

**Typography**
* I used Google Fonts to select the fonts for my project. The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in the case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. It's a common font and easy to read for the users.
* Kavivanar, cursive is used throughout the whole website for headings to give a smooth look to the website.I thought the cursive Kavivanar is a unique handwriting font and could be related to teaching style handwriting.


 **Imagery**
* The Imagery is very important so I went with a calm and classic style of hero-images to introduce the users to the atmosphere of music and sound. I received inspirations from this site (https://usersnap.com/blog/background-webdesign/)


## Features

### Existing features 
+ The project consists of 4 different pages which can be accessed through the menu in the navbar. All features are responsive on all device sizes.
+ Header Logo - on every page. Acts as a navigation link back to the user's home page.
+ Each page features a responsive navigation bar with conventional placing of logo and brand name (top left).
+ The navigation is made to be fixed at the top so users can jump to any section with the click on the navlinks. Each section details relevant information required to convince users to join music school. The full navigation menu shrinks down to a small menu with a hamburger dropdown menu when on smaller devices i.e phones.
+ Modals - used throughout the site to allow actions to be taken without navigating the user away from the necessary page. In order to help the users to join music school, the webiste provides a sign up form on Pricing packages as well as information convincing the users that Voice and Piano Music School is a great option for people who want to learn or improve music skills.
+ Each page has a footer with information about school, opening hours, contact details and social media links when clicked on, opens out a new tab to the company’s respective social page e.g. their Youtube page. These links are displayed as icons that were taken from Font Awesome.
At the bottom of each page there is a copyright information.

## Testing

1. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera & Microsoft Edge - were used to view the site in different browsers.
2. Chrome DevTools - was used generously for styling and spacing and also viewport screens. I had issues with cards on mobile and Ipad screens being unequal than the screen and this was easily fixed by giving the cards elements an explicit height .
