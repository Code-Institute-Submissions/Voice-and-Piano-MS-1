# Milestone 1 - Voice and Piano Music School
(design/mockup-Voice-and -piano.JPG)
This website was created for the first milestone project, for the Full Stack Developer Course. The project made is a small website for a Music School. 
This website has been built for a good friend, teacher and founder within Voice and Piano Music School.
 The purpose of this project is to create a new modern website, more attractive and functional for her school, which has already an existing own website (https://vocepian.wordpress.com/). 
The main purpose of the website would be to get people to interest in taking the music classes from this music school. It promotes the positive benefits of learning music to help sell the classes. The website will display the 3 types of classes that they teach: singing, piano and music theory.

## User Stories

This section provides insight into the UX process, focusing on who this website is for, the main aims of the project and how the website can help users meet their needs.
##### New users:
* As a user who is thinking about learning a piano or singing, I want to find out information that might convince me to take a class. The option of taking a free trial class would be quite appealing.
* As a user who has already begun learning piano or singing, perhaps I want to find some more formal training, to help me progress, or to add other related skills like music theory.
* As a user who might have children who are interested in music, I want to find out if these classes look appropriate, who the teachers are and where they take place.
* As a user who is thinking about learning the piano or singing, I want to know about the online class options.
* As a user who is thinking to take music classes, I want to know the location of the school so I can attend their classes.
* As a user who is thinking to take music classes, I want to be aware of their values and what makes them unique for the purpose of deciding if they are the best to teach me music classes.
 * As a user who decides to take music classes, I want to access their sign up form in order to register my interest with the school.

##### Business Owner:

* I am one of the owners of the school and want to see the school succeed. I want to clearly display information about upcoming classes in an attractive and informative way, and I want visitors to be able to easily able to contact the school easily.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Strategy


#### Scope plane:
The key features of the website were developed based on user needs. Users should be able to do the following on the website:

* Find out information about classes, content and price
* Learn about the benefits of music
* View the opinions of other students that have completed the music classes
* Contact the music school 
* Visit social media channels
* Learn more about the music school 

#### Structure
 I grouped the features into four main pages: Home, About, Classes and Contact.
 I wanted the pages to have some consistency, so thought about the homepage hero image, and how the following pages would also start with a header image, which would be shorter than the homepage hero image but following the same pattern. I decided that I didn’t want the images across all devices, except from the hero image of the Home page to cover the full screen because the user would scroll down too much to discover the content of the page.

#### Skeleton

### Surface
I created a moodboard with Adobe Spark from the research of colors, styles and components to visually illustrate the style I wished to pursue. You can see that moodboard [here].(design/moodboard.voiceandpiano.pdf)

As a starting point I used the image chosen for my landing page which helped to choose the color pallete for the entire website.
Below is a picture of the color palette I got off the website Coolors [https://coolors.co/]
![color-scheme](design/color-scheme.png)
 I used a combination of red, brown and pastel color like peach. 
I decided on this combination because, according to this article [https://99designs.ie/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/]:
* Red can also increase a person’s appetite and can develop a passion for something, in this case would be learning apetite;
* Pastel colors like peach can also have an uplifting effect on your mood;
* Brown makes you feel down to earth and creates a sense of stability and support. It’s warm and friendly, practical and dependable, and can also represent the old fashioned and well established.

**Typography**
* I used Google Fonts to select the fonts for my project. The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in the case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. It's a common font and easy to read for the users.
* Kavivanar, cursive is used throughout the whole website for headings to give a smooth look to the website.I thought the cursive Kavivanar is a unique handwriting font and could be related to teaching style handwriting.


 **Imagery**
* The Imagery is very important so I went with a calm and classic style of hero-images to introduce the users to the atmosphere of music and sound. 
* Wireframes

## Testing

1. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera & Microsoft Edge - were used to view the site in different browsers.
2. Chrome DevTools - was used generously for styling and spacing and also viewport screens. I had issues with cards on mobile and Ipad screens being unequal than the screen and need to set a specific height of cards elements.

* Navigation bar links:

- Launch the Voice and Piano website to display its homepage on screen.
- If on a mobile or tablet screen, click the hamburger icon in the top right hand corner, for the dropdown menu of the website's different sections. If on a laptop or desktop monitor, access the menu on the menu links located in the top right hand.

* Social media icons:

- Click on each social media icon one by one.
- Verify that clicking on each of these icons, opens up a new tab to the homepage of their respective website.
